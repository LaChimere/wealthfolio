# Task Checklist

> Purpose: execution-phase checklist derived from
> `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/plan.md`. Treat this as the progress truth
> source.

## Task

- Summary: Migrate Wealthfolio from Electron + Rust sidecar/backend to
  full-stack TypeScript/Bun.
- Links:
  - `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/goal.md`
  - `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/research.md`
  - `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/design.md`

## Plan Reference

- Plan version/date: PR sequence v1.
- Approved by (if applicable): user instructed implementation to start after
  planning.

## Checklist

### Preparation

- [x] Register persistent goal state.
  - Evidence: `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/goal.md`
- [x] Capture initial architecture research and migration constraints.
  - Evidence: `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/research.md`
- [x] Draft staged PR decomposition/design.
  - Evidence: `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/design.md`
- [x] Gate 1: approve design before implementation planning.
  - Evidence: user instructed to stop planning and start implementation.

### Implementation

- [x] PR 1: TS backend contract foundation.
  - Acceptance criteria: current command/API surface is represented in typed TS
    contracts and parity harness smoke coverage exists without runtime changes.
  - Evidence: `packages/backend-contracts` package with command-surface parser,
    classification tests, normalization helpers, parity smoke commands, and
    addon-host canary contract.
- [x] PR 2: TS backend runtime skeleton.
  - Acceptance criteria: guarded TS backend skeleton supports health/readiness,
    sidecar-token/auth parity, and Electron lifecycle tests while Rust remains
    default.
  - Evidence: `apps/backend` Bun runtime skeleton with config/auth/CORS/timeout
    tests; Electron runtime selector defaults to Rust and can explicitly spawn
    TS backend in dev/test.
- [x] PR 3: TS SQLite foundation.
  - Acceptance criteria: TS storage can open existing DBs, preserve migration
    history/PRAGMAs, and pass read/backup/restore parity fixtures.
  - Evidence: `apps/backend/src/storage/sqlite.ts` uses `bun:sqlite`, existing
    Rust migration files, Diesel-compatible migration history, Rust-aligned
    PRAGMAs, and backup/restore fixtures.
- [x] PR 4: Cross-cutting compatibility preflights.
  - Acceptance criteria: keyring service IDs, addon canary, command registry
    classification, and mixed-version sync fixture requirements are documented
    and tested without runtime behavior changes.
  - Evidence: `packages/backend-contracts/src/compatibility-preflights.ts`
    defines and tests keyring service IDs, command deltas, addon host canary
    requirements, and mixed-version sync command visibility.
- [ ] PR 5+: Domain vertical slices.
  - Acceptance criteria: each migrated domain has Rust-vs-TS parity for reads,
    writes, validation, errors, events, and adapter behavior while remaining
    inert for production until TS cutover.
  - Evidence: settings and accounts domain TS repository/service implementations
    plus guarded route tests in `apps/backend/src/domains/settings.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/accounts.ts`, and `apps/backend/src/http.test.ts`.
- [ ] PR 8: Default TS backend cutover.
  - Acceptance criteria: Electron and web use TS backend by default with
    rollback/fallback documented for stabilization plus benchmark gates.
  - Evidence: pending.
- [ ] PR 9: Rust removal cleanup.
  - Acceptance criteria: Rust runtime/build/release paths are removed after TS
    parity and docs describe TS-only architecture.
  - Evidence: pending.

### Acceptance Gate (before proposing PR)

- [ ] All acceptance criteria above are met with evidence.
- [ ] Diff is consistent with approved plan (no scope creep, no missing pieces).
- [ ] Applicable verification level executed.

If any check fails, follow the recovery flow defined in the active framework
contract:

1. Can fix directly -> fix and re-verify
2. Plan is infeasible -> update `plan.md`, re-submit for Gate 2
3. Design is invalid -> update `design.md`, re-submit for Gate 1 -> Gate 2
4. Stuck -> stop and report to user with evidence of what was attempted

### Verification (Evidence)

- [x] Run lint/typecheck: `bun run check` (attach output/excerpt).
- [x] Run unit tests: targeted TS backend/domain tests (attach output/excerpt).
- [ ] Run integration/e2e or before/after check: parity harness and selected
      Electron/web smoke flows (attach proof).
- [ ] Capture logs/metrics for performance-sensitive calculation/import slices.

### Review / Packaging

- [ ] Summarize changes (what/why).
- [ ] Confirm no scope creep / unrelated cleanup.
- [ ] Check whether related docs need updating.
- [ ] Prepare PR description / changelog notes (if applicable).

## Evidence Log

- `research/decomposition`: initial evidence and PR sequence recorded in
  `research.md` and `design.md`.
- `pr1-contract-foundation`: targeted checks passed:
  `bun run --cwd packages/backend-contracts test` and
  `bun run --cwd packages/backend-contracts type-check`.
- `pr1-repo-check`: full repo check passed with `bun run check`.
- `pr2-runtime-skeleton`: targeted checks passed:
  `bun run --cwd apps/backend test`, `bun run --cwd apps/backend type-check`,
  `bun run --cwd apps/electron test`, and
  `bun run --cwd apps/electron type-check`.
- `pr2-repo-check`: full repo check passed with `bun run check`.
- `pr2-review-fix`: code review found the guarded debug route was open when no
  sidecar token was configured; fixed it to fail closed and re-ran targeted
  checks plus `bun run check`.
- `pr3-sqlite-foundation`: targeted checks passed:
  `bun run --cwd apps/backend test` and `bun run --cwd apps/backend type-check`.
- `pr3-repo-check`: full repo check passed with `bun run check`.
- `pr3-review-fix`: code review requested whitespace-only `DATABASE_URL`
  coverage; added the edge-case test and re-ran backend checks plus
  `bun run check`.
- `pr4-compat-preflights`: targeted checks passed:
  `bun run --cwd packages/backend-contracts test` and
  `bun run --cwd packages/backend-contracts type-check`.
- `pr4-repo-check`: full repo check passed with `bun run check`.
- `pr5-settings-domain`: targeted checks passed:
  `bun run --cwd apps/backend test` and `bun run --cwd apps/backend type-check`.
- `pr5-settings-repo-check`: full repo check passed with `bun run check`.
- `pr5-accounts-domain`: targeted checks passed:
  `bun run --cwd apps/backend type-check` and `bun run --cwd apps/backend test`.
  Accounts coverage includes generated IDs, list filters/sort order, immutable
  update fields, archive/tracking-mode preservation, Rust-compatible group
  clearing, delete events, orphaned investment cleanup hooks, and guarded HTTP
  routes.
- `pr5-accounts-review`: code review found transaction-boundary and event
  snapshot issues during refinement; create/update now read back inside
  transaction boundaries and update events use transaction-captured before/after
  snapshots. Final review found no remaining actionable issues.
- `pr5-accounts-repo-check`: full repo check passed with `bun run check`.

## Result

- Outcome: PR 1 contract foundation, PR 2 guarded TS backend runtime skeleton,
  PR 3 TS SQLite foundation, and PR 4 compatibility preflights implemented; PR 5
  settings and accounts domain slices implemented; broader migration remains
  active.
- Follow-ups: continue low-risk domain slices.
