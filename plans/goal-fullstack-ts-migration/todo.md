# Task Checklist

> Purpose: execution-phase checklist derived from
> `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/plan.md`. Treat this as the progress truth
> source.

## Task

- Summary: Migrate Wealthfolio from Electron + Rust sidecar/backend to
  full-stack TypeScript/Bun.
- Links:
  - `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/goal.md`
  - `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/research.md`
  - `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/design.md`

## Plan Reference

- Plan version/date: PR sequence v1.
- Approved by (if applicable): user instructed implementation to start after
  planning.

## Checklist

### Preparation

- [x] Register persistent goal state.
  - Evidence: `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/goal.md`
- [x] Capture initial architecture research and migration constraints.
  - Evidence: `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/research.md`
- [x] Draft staged PR decomposition/design.
  - Evidence: `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/design.md`
- [x] Gate 1: approve design before implementation planning.
  - Evidence: user instructed to stop planning and start implementation.

### Implementation

- [x] PR 1: TS backend contract foundation.
  - Acceptance criteria: current command/API surface is represented in typed TS
    contracts and parity harness smoke coverage exists without runtime changes.
  - Evidence: `packages/backend-contracts` package with command-surface parser,
    classification tests, normalization helpers, parity smoke commands, and
    addon-host canary contract.
- [x] PR 2: TS backend runtime skeleton.
  - Acceptance criteria: guarded TS backend skeleton supports health/readiness,
    sidecar-token/auth parity, and Electron lifecycle tests while Rust remains
    default.
  - Evidence: `apps/backend` Bun runtime skeleton with config/auth/CORS/timeout
    tests; Electron runtime selector defaults to Rust and can explicitly spawn
    TS backend in dev/test.
- [x] PR 3: TS SQLite foundation.
  - Acceptance criteria: TS storage can open existing DBs, preserve migration
    history/PRAGMAs, and pass read/backup/restore parity fixtures.
  - Evidence: `apps/backend/src/storage/sqlite.ts` uses `bun:sqlite`, existing
    Rust migration files, Diesel-compatible migration history, Rust-aligned
    PRAGMAs, and backup/restore fixtures.
- [x] PR 4: Cross-cutting compatibility preflights.
  - Acceptance criteria: keyring service IDs, addon canary, command registry
    classification, and mixed-version sync fixture requirements are documented
    and tested without runtime behavior changes.
  - Evidence: `packages/backend-contracts/src/compatibility-preflights.ts`
    defines and tests keyring service IDs, command deltas, addon host canary
    requirements, and mixed-version sync command visibility.
- [ ] PR 5+: Domain vertical slices.
  - Acceptance criteria: each migrated domain has Rust-vs-TS parity for reads,
    writes, validation, errors, events, and adapter behavior while remaining
    inert for production until TS cutover.
  - Evidence: settings, accounts, contribution limits, taxonomy, custom
    provider, scoped goals, local exchange-rate, local health, market-data
    provider settings, portfolio job trigger, event stream, secrets, AI
    provider, alternative assets, assets, and app utilities TS
    repository/service or route config implementations plus guarded route tests
    in `apps/backend/src/domains/settings.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/accounts.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/contribution-limits.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/taxonomies.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/custom-providers.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/goals.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/exchange-rates.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/health.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/market-data-providers.ts`,
    `apps/backend/src/domains/portfolio-jobs.ts`, and
    `apps/backend/src/events.ts`, and `apps/backend/src/http.test.ts`. Health
    status/check/fix and taxonomy migration endpoints are deferred to the
    health/classification service slice; custom provider `test-source` is
    deferred to an external-I/O slice; goals plan writes and calculation
    endpoints are deferred to calculation-heavy slices; FX converter/history and
    provider sync behavior plus broader market-data quote/search/import/sync
    behavior are deferred to calculation/market-data slices; actual portfolio
    job execution and event production are deferred to portfolio/calculation
    slices; real secret persistence/keyring integration is deferred to a
    runtime/keyring parity slice; AI provider catalog/settings/model-listing
    runtime behavior is deferred to AI/secrets parity slices; alternative asset
    persistence/quotes/holdings/job behavior is deferred to asset/portfolio
    parity slices; asset persistence/profile/quote-mode behavior is deferred to
    asset/market-data/portfolio parity slices; app runtime metadata,
    update-check HTTP/cache, backup/restore I/O, and path normalization are
    deferred to app utility parity slices.
- [ ] PR 8: Default TS backend cutover.
  - Acceptance criteria: Electron and web use TS backend by default with
    rollback/fallback documented for stabilization plus benchmark gates.
  - Evidence: pending.
- [ ] PR 9: Rust removal cleanup.
  - Acceptance criteria: Rust runtime/build/release paths are removed after TS
    parity and docs describe TS-only architecture.
  - Evidence: pending.

### Acceptance Gate (before proposing PR)

- [ ] All acceptance criteria above are met with evidence.
- [ ] Diff is consistent with approved plan (no scope creep, no missing pieces).
- [ ] Applicable verification level executed.

If any check fails, follow the recovery flow defined in the active framework
contract:

1. Can fix directly -> fix and re-verify
2. Plan is infeasible -> update `plan.md`, re-submit for Gate 2
3. Design is invalid -> update `design.md`, re-submit for Gate 1 -> Gate 2
4. Stuck -> stop and report to user with evidence of what was attempted

### Verification (Evidence)

- [x] Run lint/typecheck: `bun run check` (attach output/excerpt).
- [x] Run unit tests: targeted TS backend/domain tests (attach output/excerpt).
- [ ] Run integration/e2e or before/after check: parity harness and selected
      Electron/web smoke flows (attach proof).
- [ ] Capture logs/metrics for performance-sensitive calculation/import slices.

### Review / Packaging

- [ ] Summarize changes (what/why).
- [ ] Confirm no scope creep / unrelated cleanup.
- [ ] Check whether related docs need updating.
- [ ] Prepare PR description / changelog notes (if applicable).

  suppression, custom taxonomy sync bundle/delete hooks, category child and
  asset assignment delete guards, move-category behavior, and guarded HTTP
  mutation routes.
- `pr5-taxonomies-crud-review`: code review flagged mutable `created_at` fields
  on update; Rust repository updates from the full submitted Taxonomy/Category
  structs, so the TS slice kept parity and added explicit tests for that
  behavior. No remaining actionable issues.
- `pr5-taxonomies-crud-repo-check`: full repo check passed with `bun run check`.
- `pr5-taxonomies-assignments`: targeted checks passed:

  values, parent links, export tree sorting, ignored instrument mappings parity,
  missing taxonomy errors, and guarded HTTP import/export routes.
- `pr5-taxonomies-import-export-review`: first review raised transaction
  atomicity as a concern; Rust uses separate create and bulk-category writes, so
  the TS slice kept parity. Focused second review found no remaining actionable
  issues.
- `pr5-taxonomies-import-export-repo-check`: full repo check passed with
  `bun run check`.
- `pr5-custom-providers-crud`: targeted checks passed:
  `bun run --cwd apps/backend type-check` and `bun run --cwd apps/backend test`.

  provider fallback, generated FX assets and instrument keys, provider config
  parity for Yahoo, quote upserts, manual update source behavior, decimal-string
  validation, quote-plus-asset deletes, asset sync hooks, guarded HTTP CRUD
  routes, and local-only scope.
- `pr5-exchange-rates-crud-review`: code review raised FX quote `volume` null
  versus zero as a possible parity issue; Rust `QuoteDB::from(&Quote)` maps zero
  volume to `NULL`, so no code change was required. No remaining actionable
  issues.
- `pr5-exchange-rates-crud-repo-check`: full repo check passed with

## Result

- Outcome: PR 1 contract foundation, PR 2 guarded TS backend runtime skeleton,
  PR 3 TS SQLite foundation, and PR 4 compatibility preflights implemented; PR 5
  settings, accounts, contribution limits, taxonomy read, and taxonomy/category
  mutation, assignment, import/export, custom provider CRUD, and scoped goals
  CRUD/funding plus local exchange-rate CRUD and local health dismissal/config
  plus market-data provider settings, portfolio job trigger, event stream,
  secrets route seam, AI provider route seam, alternative assets route seam,
  assets route seam, and app utility route seam slices implemented; broader
  migration remains active.
- Follow-ups: continue other low-risk domain slices; taxonomy migration/health
  endpoints move with the health/classification services; custom provider
  `test-source` moves with external-I/O services; goals plan write/delete,
  summary refresh, save-up overview, and retirement simulation endpoints move
  with calculation-heavy goal slices; FX converter/history/register-pair and
  provider sync plus broader market-data quote/search/import/sync behavior move
  with calculation/market-data slices; actual portfolio job execution and event
  production move with portfolio/calculation slices; real secret persistence and
  keyring integration move with a dedicated runtime parity slice; AI provider
  catalog/settings/model-listing runtime behavior moves with AI/secrets parity
  slices; alternative asset persistence/quotes/holdings/job behavior moves with
  asset/portfolio parity slices; asset persistence/profile/quote-mode behavior
  moves with asset/market-data/portfolio parity slices; app runtime metadata,
  update-check HTTP/cache, backup/restore I/O, and path normalization move with
  app utility parity slices.
