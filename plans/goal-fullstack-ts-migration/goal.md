## Acceptance criteria

### User-visible behavior

- Electron desktop and web mode run from a TypeScript/Bun backend without
  requiring a Rust sidecar or Rust web server at runtime.
- Existing portfolio, account, activity, asset, goals, health, AI, add-on,
  Connect, device-sync, secrets, imports, backups, update, and native desktop
  workflows remain behaviorally compatible.
- Existing SQLite user data can be opened, migrated, backed up, and restored by
  the TypeScript backend without data loss.

### Implementation scope

- Replace `apps/server` and `crates/*` Rust runtime responsibilities with
  TypeScript/Bun packages while keeping Electron main/preload and frontend
  adapter APIs stable during migration.
- Preserve API/IPC command names, request/response shapes, event names, database
  schema semantics, and addon-facing host APIs until explicit compatibility
  changes are designed.
- Add a parity harness that can compare Rust and TypeScript behavior during the
  transition before removing the Rust implementation.
- Remove Rust build, package, sidecar, CI, release, and documentation paths only
  after TypeScript parity is proven.

### Validation

- Use contract/golden tests against existing Rust behavior for every migrated
  domain, especially calculations, imports, migrations, sync, secrets, and
  crypto.
- Keep `bun run check`, targeted TypeScript tests, Electron tests, web tests,
  and relevant integration/e2e checks passing at every slice.
- Run repeated self-review plus rubber-duck/code-review/pr-review refinement for
  high-risk slices before advancing.

### Docs/status

- Maintain
  `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/{goal.md,research.md,design.md,plan.md,todo.md}`
  as the migration status anchor.
- Update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, architecture docs, release docs, and
  developer runbooks when confirmed changes make Rust-sidecar instructions
  stale.

### Deferred/out of scope

- Cosmetic UI redesign is out of scope. reason=out_of_scope
- Product feature expansion unrelated to Rust-to-TypeScript parity is out of
  scope. reason=out_of_scope

## Progress log

- Turn 0: Goal registered. Initial workflow classification requires research and
  design because this is a correctness-critical, multi-component backend rewrite
  with data, API, security, sync, and release impacts.
- Turn 1: Captured architecture research, drafted staged TS migration design,
  ran rubber-duck design review, and refined the design to address SQLite stack,
  dual-writer, normalization, keyring, device-sync, addon, rollback, benchmark,
  and CI risks before Gate 1.
- Turn 2: Implemented and refined the low-risk accounts TS domain slice:
  repository/service behavior, guarded HTTP routes, Rust-parity validation and
  events, transaction-bound create/update readbacks, orphaned asset cleanup
  hooks, and targeted backend tests.
- Turn 3: Implemented the low-risk contribution limits TS domain slice: CRUD
  repository/service parity, guarded `/api/v1/limits` routes, lightweight
  portfolio update hooks, empty-account deposits parity, injectable future
  deposit calculation, targeted backend tests, and review.
- Turn 4: Started the taxonomies TS migration as a smaller atomic sub-slice:
  read repository/service models, guarded `/api/v1/taxonomies` read routes,
  ordering/date/boolean parity coverage, and targeted backend checks.
- Turn 5: Extended the taxonomies TS slice with taxonomy/category create,
  update, delete, move-category behavior, custom-taxonomy sync hooks, system
  delete guards, child/assignment delete guards, guarded mutation routes, and
  targeted backend tests.
- Turn 6: Added the taxonomies assignment TS sub-slice: asset assignment reads,
  upsert conflict parity, single-select replacement behavior, delete behavior,
  optional assignment sync hooks, guarded assignment HTTP routes, and targeted
  backend tests.
- Turn 7: Completed the low-risk taxonomy import/export TS sub-slice: Portfolio
  Performance-compatible JSON parsing, recursive category flattening/export tree
  reconstruction, ignored instrument mappings parity, guarded import/export HTTP
  routes, and targeted backend tests.

## Deferred items

- Taxonomy migration/health endpoints remain active follow-ups. reason=they
  depend on health/assets/classification services and should move with that
  higher-risk slice.

## Blockers

- None.
