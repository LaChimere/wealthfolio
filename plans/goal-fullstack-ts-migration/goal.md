## Acceptance criteria

### User-visible behavior

- Electron desktop and web mode run from a TypeScript/Bun backend without
  requiring a Rust sidecar or Rust web server at runtime.
- Existing portfolio, account, activity, asset, goals, health, AI, add-on,
  Connect, device-sync, secrets, imports, backups, update, and native desktop
  workflows remain behaviorally compatible.
- Existing SQLite user data can be opened, migrated, backed up, and restored by
  the TypeScript backend without data loss.

### Implementation scope

- Replace `apps/server` and `crates/*` Rust runtime responsibilities with
  TypeScript/Bun packages while keeping Electron main/preload and frontend
  adapter APIs stable during migration.
- Preserve API/IPC command names, request/response shapes, event names, database
  schema semantics, and addon-facing host APIs until explicit compatibility
  changes are designed.
- Add a parity harness that can compare Rust and TypeScript behavior during the
  transition before removing the Rust implementation.
- Remove Rust build, package, sidecar, CI, release, and documentation paths only
  after TypeScript parity is proven.

### Validation

- Use contract/golden tests against existing Rust behavior for every migrated
  domain, especially calculations, imports, migrations, sync, secrets, and
  crypto.
- Keep `bun run check`, targeted TypeScript tests, Electron tests, web tests,
  and relevant integration/e2e checks passing at every slice.
- Run repeated self-review plus rubber-duck/code-review/pr-review refinement for
  high-risk slices before advancing.

### Docs/status

- Maintain
  `plans/goal-fullstack-ts-migration/{goal.md,research.md,design.md,plan.md,todo.md}`
  as the migration status anchor.
- Update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, architecture docs, release docs, and
  developer runbooks when confirmed changes make Rust-sidecar instructions
  stale.

### Deferred/out of scope

- Cosmetic UI redesign is out of scope. reason=out_of_scope
- Product feature expansion unrelated to Rust-to-TypeScript parity is out of
  scope. reason=out_of_scope

## Progress log

- Turn 0: Goal registered. Initial workflow classification requires research and
  design because this is a correctness-critical, multi-component backend rewrite
  with data, API, security, sync, and release impacts.
- Turn 1: Captured architecture research, drafted staged TS migration design,
  ran rubber-duck design review, and refined the design to address SQLite stack,
  dual-writer, normalization, keyring, device-sync, addon, rollback, benchmark,
  and CI risks before Gate 1.
- Turn 2: Implemented and refined the low-risk accounts TS domain slice:
  repository/service behavior, guarded HTTP routes, Rust-parity validation and
  events, transaction-bound create/update readbacks, orphaned asset cleanup
  hooks, and targeted backend tests.
- Turn 3: Implemented the low-risk contribution limits TS domain slice: CRUD
  repository/service parity, guarded `/api/v1/limits` routes, lightweight
  portfolio update hooks, empty-account deposits parity, injectable future
  deposit calculation, targeted backend tests, and review.
- Turn 4: Started the taxonomies TS migration as a smaller atomic sub-slice:
  read repository/service models, guarded `/api/v1/taxonomies` read routes,
  ordering/date/boolean parity coverage, and targeted backend checks.
- Turn 5: Extended the taxonomies TS slice with taxonomy/category create,
  update, delete, move-category behavior, custom-taxonomy sync hooks, system
  delete guards, child/assignment delete guards, guarded mutation routes, and
  targeted backend tests.
- Turn 6: Added the taxonomies assignment TS sub-slice: asset assignment reads,
  upsert conflict parity, single-select replacement behavior, delete behavior,
  optional assignment sync hooks, guarded assignment HTTP routes, and targeted
  backend tests.
- Turn 7: Completed the low-risk taxonomy import/export TS sub-slice: Portfolio
  Performance-compatible JSON parsing, recursive category flattening/export tree
  reconstruction, ignored instrument mappings parity, guarded import/export HTTP
  routes, and targeted backend tests.
- Turn 8: Implemented the low-risk custom provider CRUD TS slice: provider
  list/create/update/delete behavior, source config parsing, reserved-code and
  source validation, asset-reference delete guards, sync hooks keyed by provider
  UUID, guarded HTTP routes, and targeted backend tests.
- Turn 9: Implemented the scoped goals TS slice for base persistence: goal
  list/get/create/update/delete behavior, funding rule reads/replacement,
  read-only goal plan access, base-currency forcing at the HTTP seam, retirement
  seed funding, lifecycle/retirement uniqueness/capacity/DC-link guards, sync
  hooks, guarded HTTP routes, and targeted backend tests.
- Turn 10: Implemented the local exchange-rate TS slice: latest FX reads,
  add/update/delete behavior, FX asset creation, quote upserts, provider-config
  parity for common providers, asset sync hooks, guarded HTTP routes, and
  targeted backend tests.
- Turn 11: Implemented the low-risk health local-state TS slice: issue dismissal
  save/replace/restore/list behavior, in-memory health config defaults and
  validation, guarded `/api/v1/health/{dismiss,restore,dismissed,config}`
  routes, explicit deferred health status/check/fix behavior, and targeted
  backend tests.
- Turn 12: Implemented the low-risk market-data provider settings TS slice:
  provider info reads, priority/enabled updates, capabilities/API-key metadata,
  quote-sync asset/error stats, guarded `/api/v1/providers` and
  `/api/v1/providers/settings` routes, explicit deferred market-data
  search/quotes/sync behavior, and targeted backend tests.
- Turn 13: Implemented the low-risk portfolio job trigger TS slice: request
  normalization for update/recalculate jobs, Rust-compatible default market-sync
  modes, full vs incremental recalculation config, guarded
  `/api/v1/portfolio/{update,recalculate}` routes, explicit deferred SSE/job
  execution behavior, and targeted backend tests.
- Turn 14: Implemented the low-risk backend event stream TS slice: event bus SSE
  formatting, keep-alive stream plumbing, guarded `/api/v1/events/stream` route,
  exported stream helpers, and targeted backend tests.
- Turn 15: Implemented the low-risk secrets HTTP seam TS slice: injectable
  `SecretService`, guarded `/api/v1/secrets` set/get/delete route, validation
  for secret body/query input, and targeted backend tests.

## Deferred items

- Taxonomy migration/health endpoints remain active follow-ups. reason=they
  depend on health/assets/classification services and should move with that
  higher-risk slice.
- Custom provider `test-source` remains an active follow-up. reason=it depends
  on external HTTP fetches, secrets, parser/extractor behavior, and response
  safety limits that belong in a dedicated external-I/O slice.
- Goals plan write/delete, summary refresh, save-up overview, and retirement
  simulation endpoints remain active follow-ups. reason=they require retirement
  plan validation/calculation parity and should move in dedicated
  calculation-heavy slices.
- FX currency converter, historical lookup, register-pair, and automatic market
  sync behavior remain active follow-ups. reason=they depend on calculation,
  quote history, and provider sync parity beyond local exchange-rate CRUD.
- Health status/check/fix endpoints and classification migration behavior remain
  active follow-ups. reason=they depend on holdings, quotes, FX, assets,
  valuation, taxonomy, market sync, and classification migration parity beyond
  local health dismissal/config state.
- Market-data search, quote history/latest/update/delete/import, Yahoo
  dividends, symbol resolution, exchange list, and sync endpoints remain active
  follow-ups. reason=they depend on provider HTTP clients, quote import parsing,
  portfolio recalculation jobs, exchange metadata, and market sync parity beyond
  local provider settings.
- Actual portfolio job execution and event production remain active follow-ups.
  reason=they depend on market sync, holdings, snapshot, valuation, account,
  health, and FX service parity beyond route-level job enqueue and SSE transport
  semantics.
- Real secret persistence/keyring integration remains an active follow-up.
  reason=this slice only adds the guarded HTTP seam, while production secrets
  must move with a dedicated runtime/keyring parity slice.

## Blockers

- None.
